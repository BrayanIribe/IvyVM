IvyVM is an application that was born thanks to one class of **computer architecture** at **ITSON**. In that class we saw how CPU work theoretically. However, since we cannot practice that, I created this application that emulates that CPU.

**This tool is still in development. The syntax, opcodes or arguments can change without any advice.**

I'm fan of ASM and reverse engineering, so this tool does use stack and some things that we see in **real ASM**. So, if you want to learn ASM but you don't know how, this application is for you.

You can see started in the [wiki](https://github.com/BrayanIribe/IvyVM/wiki/Welcome).

The **commands.txt** contains the opcodes to make scripts! 
You can use C++ syntax on VS Code for highlighting.
