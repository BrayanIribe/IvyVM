IvyVM is a Virtual Machine (VM) that was born thanks to one class of **computer architecture** at **ITSON**. In that class we saw how CPU work theoretically. However, since we cannot practice that, I created this application that emulates that CPU.

**This tool is still in development. The syntax, opcodes or arguments can change without any advice.**

IvyVM interprets instructions that are provided inside of a file. The CPU architecture and memory addresses are primitives.

## Example

IvyVM is running a simple calculator that do sums. You can see the original source [here](https://github.com/BrayanIribe/IvyVM/blob/master/scripts/calc.ivy).

You can find example scripts in **scripts** folder, and run them with the VM.

## About

I'm fan of ASM and reverse engineering, so this tool does use stack and some things that we see in **real ASM**. So, if you want to learn ASM but you don't know how, this application is for you.

You can get started in the [wiki](https://github.com/BrayanIribe/IvyVM/wiki/1---Home).
